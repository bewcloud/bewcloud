# bewCloud

[![](https://github.com/bewcloud/bewcloud/workflows/Run%20Tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/bewcloud/bewcloud/actions?workflow=Run+Tests)

This is the [bewCloud app](https://bewcloud.com) built using [Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev) and deployed using [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

If you're looking for the desktop sync app, it's at [`bewcloud-desktop`](https://github.com/bewcloud/bewcloud-desktop).

If you're looking for the mobile app, it's at [`bewcloud-mobile`](https://github.com/bewcloud/bewcloud-mobile).

## Self-host it!

Or on your own machine:

Download/copy [`docker-compose.yml`](/docker-compose.yml), [`.env.sample`](/.env.sample) as `.env`, and [`bewcloud.config.sample.ts`](/bewcloud.config.sample.ts) as `bewcloud.config.ts`.

> [!NOTE]
> `1993:1993` below comes from deno's [docker image](https://github.com/denoland/deno_docker/blob/2abfe921484bdc79d11c7187a9d7b59537457c31/ubuntu.dockerfile#L20-L22) where `1993` is the default user id in it. It might change in the future since I don't control it.

```sh
$ mkdir data-files # local directory for storing user-uploaded files
$ sudo chown -R 1993:1993 data-files # solves permission-related issues in the container with uploading files
$ docker compose up -d # makes the app available at http://localhost:8000
$ docker compose run --rm website bash -c "cd /app && make migrate-db" # initializes/updates the database (only needs to be executed the first time and on any data updates)
```

## Development

### Requirements

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Don't forget to set up your `.env` file based on `.env.sample`.
> Don't forget to set up your `bewcloud.config.ts` file based on `bewcloud.config.sample.ts`.

- This was tested with [`Deno`](https://deno.land)'s version stated in the `.dvmrc` file, though other versions may work.
- For the postgres dependency (used when running locally or in CI), you should have `Docker` and `docker compose` installed.

### Commands

```sh
$ docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up # (optional) runs docker with postgres, locally
$ make migrate-db # runs any missing database migrations
$ make start # runs the app
$ make format # formats the code
$ make test # runs tests
```

### Other less-used commands

```sh
$ make exec-db # runs psql inside the postgres container, useful for running direct development queries like `DROP DATABASE "bewcloud"; CREATE DATABASE "bewcloud";`
$ make build # generates all static files for production deploy
```

## Structure

- Routes defined at `routes/`.
- Static files are defined at `static/`.
- Frontend-only components are defined at `components/`.
- Isomorphic components are defined at `islands/`.
- Cron jobs are defined at `crons/`.
- Reusable bits of code are defined at `lib/`.
- Database migrations are defined at `db-migrations/`.

## Deployment

Just push to the `main` branch.

## Where's Contacts/Calendar (CardDav/CalDav)?! Wasn't this supposed to be a core Nextcloud replacement?

[Check this tag/release for more info and the code where/when that was being done](https://github.com/bewcloud/bewcloud/releases/tag/v0.0.1-self-made-carddav-caldav). Contacts/CardDav worked and Calendar/CalDav mostly worked as well at that point.

My focus was to get me to replace Nextcloud for me and my family ASAP, and it turns out it's not easy to do it all in a single, installable _thing_, so I focused on the Files UI, sync, and sharing, since [Radicale](https://radicale.org/v3.html) solved my other issues better than my own solution (and it's already _very_ efficient).

## How does private file sharing work?

Public file sharing is now possible since [v2.2.0](https://github.com/bewcloud/bewcloud/releases/tag/v2.2.0). [Check this PR for advanced sharing with internal and external users, with read and write access that was being done and almost working](https://github.com/bewcloud/bewcloud/pull/4). I ditched all that complexity for simply using [symlinks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link) for internal sharing, as it served my use case (I have multiple data backups and trust the people I provide accounts to, with the symlinks).

You can simply `ln -s /<absolute-path-to-data-files>/<owner-user-id>/<directory-to-share> /<absolute-path-to-data-files>/<user-id-to-share-with>/` to create a shared directory between two users, and the same directory can have different names, now.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're running the app with docker, the symlink needs to point to the container's directory, usually starting with `/app` if you didn't change the `Dockerfile`, otherwise the container will fail to load the linked directory.

## How does it look?
